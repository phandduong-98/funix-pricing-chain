# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

0. npm start

1. npx hardhat node (if use hardhat localhost)

2. npx hardhat run --network ./script/deploy.js

3. Change "MAIN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS" in "constants.js" to deployed contract address

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
